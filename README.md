README.md

This package contains the scripts that the authors of Carson et al. 2022 (citation at the bottom) used to analyze data files from the MPI-ESM-P global climate model.  In this analysis, we explored the nature and causes of low-frequency variability of halosteric SSH and freshwater content in the Arctic in a past-1000 year CMIP5 experiment.  Details and results of this analysis can be found in the paper.

Specifics about how to use the scripts and files to generate the figures and processed datasets used in the paper are enumerated in the README.txt file contained in the zip file.
